# high-level

notes:
- try out vercel frontend components tools
  - then: what's my tech stack? 
- UI layout sketches while considering UX
  - i think different phases of each project should be diff colors though.
  - maybe each project could vary by:
    - color? no.
    - hue? no but maybe for a combined plan B
    - font? no but maybe plan C
    - depth/flat/shadows? no but maybe for a combined plan B
- additional UI elements:
  - static elements:
    - gantt
    - excel
    - lucidchart
    - screenshots of different parts of the program? doubt it.
  - dynamic elements:
    - buttons
      - to change colors for teaching effect
      - code carousel
    - embedded jupyter notebook
   
next steps:
- keep working on this^
