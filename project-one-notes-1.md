# project one (llvm project) draft 1

## c++ program code ideas: 

  - a simple program with a graph algorithm
  - begins with a list of four Strings which is the input sentence
  - then it creates a graph with each of those words as a node
  - next: apply a transformer algo with a python package and produce an output string
  - next: break down this code block by block or line by line to understand the IR

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Graph {
private:
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> adjacencyList;

public:
    void addEdge(const string& u, const string& v) {
        adjacencyList[u].push_back(v);
        adjacencyList[v].push_back(u); // Assuming undirected graph
    }

    void display() {
        for (const auto& pair : adjacencyList) {
            cout << pair.first << " -> ";
            for (const string& neighbor : pair.second) {
                cout << neighbor << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<string> input = {"This", "is", "a", "sentence"};
    
    Graph graph;
    
    // Create nodes for each word
    for (const string& word : input) {
        graph.addEdge(word, ""); // Adding node for the word
    }
    
    cout << "Graph created with nodes:\n";
    graph.display();
    
    return 0;
}

```

- ability to use a Python library that's compatible with c++
- research these more:


1. NumPy:
NumPy is a Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is one of the most popular Python libraries for scientific computing and is widely used in many different fields, such as machine learning, data science, and image processing. NumPy is written in C and C++ and provides a Python interface.

2. SciPy:
SciPy is a Python library that provides a wide range of scientific computing functions, including statistical functions, signal processing functions, and optimization functions. It is built on top of NumPy and provides a more comprehensive set of scientific computing tools. SciPy is written in C, C++, and Fortran and provides a Python interface.

3. Matplotlib:
Matplotlib is a Python library that provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating 2D and 3D plots. It is widely used in many different fields, such as scientific computing, data science, and machine learning. Matplotlib is written in Python and C++ and provides a Python interface.

4. Pandas:
Pandas is a Python library that provides data structures and operations for working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data. It is built on top of NumPy and provides a more convenient and efficient way to work with data. Pandas is written in Python and C++ and provides a Python interface.

5. PyTorch:
PyTorch is a Python library that provides a deep learning framework. It is widely used in many different fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. PyTorch is written in Python and C++ and provides a Python interface.

6. TensorFlow:
TensorFlow is a Python library that provides a machine learning framework. It is widely used in many different fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. TensorFlow is written in Python and C++ and provides a Python interface.

7. Boost.Python:
Boost.Python is a C++ library that provides a way to create Python bindings for C++ code. This allows you to call C++ functions from Python and to expose C++ classes to Python. Boost.Python is a powerful tool for interfacing between Python and C++.

8. CFFI:
CFFI is a Python library that provides a way to call C functions from Python. It is a lower-level library than Boost.Python, but it is more flexible and allows you to call C functions that are not wrapped by Boost.Python.

9. SWIG:
SWIG is a tool that can be used to generate Python bindings for C and C++ code. It is a powerful tool for interfacing between Python and C/C++.

10. Cython:
Cython is a Python language extension that allows you to write Python code that is compiled to C. This can significantly improve the performance of your Python code. Cython is a good choice for Python code that is computationally intensive.


- actually, best packages for ML transformers?

The best Python package for transformers is the Hugging Face Transformers library. It is a state-of-the-art NLP library that provides a wide range of pre-trained models for a variety of tasks, including text classification, question answering, summarization, and translation. The library is easy to use and provides a comprehensive documentation.
Here are some of the key features of the Hugging Face Transformers library:
- Wide range of pre-trained models: The library provides a wide range of pre-trained models for a variety of NLP tasks, including text classification, question answering, summarization, and translation. These models have been trained on large datasets and can be used to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks.
- Easy to use: The library is easy to use and provides a comprehensive documentation. The library provides a number of tutorials and examples that can be used to get started quickly.
- Active community: The library has an active community of users and developers. This means that there is a wealth of resources available to help users get the most out of the library.
- Regular updates: The library is regularly updated with new features and bug fixes. This means that users can be confident that they are using the latest and greatest version of the library.

- Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries — `Jax`, `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow` — with a seamless integration between them.
- PyTorch is ideal for research and small-scale projects prioritizing flexibility, experimentation and quick editing capabilities for models. TensorFlow is ideal for large-scale projects and production environments that require high-performance and scalable models.

- how can i design Project One (this project) so it's ready for Project Two (mojo/mlir)?
- Project Two additional notes (more than the README):
  - low-level IR in Mojo (implement my own GPU primitives) https://docs.modular.com/mojo/notebooks/BoolMLIR
  - Jax: "accelerator-oriented array computation and program transformation, designed for high-performance numerical computing"
  - Mojo language marries Python and MLIR for AI development: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3695588/mojo-language-marries-python-and-mlir-for-ai-development.html
  - key Mojo
    - progressive types
    - parallelization
    - ownership and borrow-checker
    - manual memory management
    - zero-cost abstractions
    - integrated auto-tuning ******* use this 
  - Lattner Lex Fridman will mojo replace PyTorch and Tensorflow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vz2X9I5Z4k
  - Modular yt channel Introduction to Tensors in Mojo🔥: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OWkXNdkx8E
  - why mojo: https://docs.modular.com/mojo/why-mojo
    - "building our platform to unify the world's ML/AI infrastructure, we realized that programming across the entire stack was too complicated. Plus, we were writing a lot of MLIR by hand and not having a good time."
    - "What we wanted was an innovative and scalable programming model that could target accelerators and other heterogeneous systems that are pervasive in the AI field. This meant a programming language with powerful compile-time metaprogramming, integration of adaptive compilation techniques, caching throughout the compilation flow, and other features that are not supported by existing languages."
   
- takeaways:
  - okay i wont be doing ^that till Project Two
  - so Project One should just be compiling LLVM and high-level/low-level IR analysis and then compare it later to Mojo/MLIR
  - alright, now I can continue with Project One

- next step:
  - CMake desktop app? (then what would be the target?)
  - CMake config with git clone llvm as target?
  - CMake config with native llvm as target? change $PATH
  - ^this has been super difficult. but at least i've studied it a tonnnnn


# DEADLINE: this FRIDAY March 22 I have to compile the simplest c++ program possible with LLVM
