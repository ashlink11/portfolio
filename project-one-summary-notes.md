# project one summary notes
#### date created: april 5, 2024

# high-level

- goal: minimal visual and verbal presentation
- visual:
  - lucidchart software architecture diagram
  - can add an excel chart if i want to
  - gantt chart for project timeline? very agile.
  - aesthetic way to display the:
    - cmake config
    - c++ code
    - terminal commands & output
    - llvm source
    - project source
    - LLVM IR ASM
    - cool map of c++ to cmake to llvm ir to bitcode to llvm asm would be crazy
  - apply the minimal verbal notes (below)
- verbal
  - absolute minimal meta. save that for the three-project summary page
    - map of a standard library
    - OOP fundamentals, etc.
    - SIMT ISAs, etc.
    - language comparisons
    - algo/ds/model progression
    - other things from meta/high/mid notes in main portfolio readme
    - in conclusion section: into projects two and three
  - high/mid/low levels for language (loose 5 paragraph essay format)
  - llvm infrastructure (and which parts i didnt use) 
  - source/install dir layout
  - c++ program layout & _which algo did i use?_
  - discuss the bitcode briefly (because it's a _**VM**_)
  - most important c++ line(s)
  - one basic block (SSA)
    - entry
    - body
    - exit
    - (remember the meta):
      - ("instructions for managing threads, accessing memory, performing arithmetic and logical operations, and controlling execution flow.")
      - "(will include arith ops for wts, memory access of course (registers, cache, RAM ideally but maybe save that for projects 2 or 3))"
  - language to compiler to ISA (to hardware) progression
  - think about how i used to want to write a compiler and language
- think about/plan UI/UX design before doing mid- and low-level plans/work

^summary/next steps:
- once i have project one high-level summary plan, make high-level frontend plan

# mid-level

# low-level
