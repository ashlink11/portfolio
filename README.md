# portfolio

## tech plan:

- high-level models and corresponding low-level code

####: high-level:

- original lucidchart diagrams for:
  - (*** mandatory) explanation of this github repo directory layout/structures and key code functionality
  - generic hardware-to-software stack
  - math and physics topics i've studied
  - how ontologic classification & linguistics correspond to OOP (& maybe show context of branches of philosophy)
  - elements of prog langs i know (C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Ruby, HTML, CSS)
  - history of significant LLM & ML research papers
  - history of ISA breakthroughs and technology, i.e. SIMD to SIMT
  - chart of metatheory, metalinguistics, metaontology, metaphilosophy, metaprogrammaing, metaML, metalogic etc.

####: low-level:

- at least one portfolio page with a Jupyter notebook:
  - use the classic MNIST dataset?
  - demo one of current promising ML theories?
  - demo integration of many current promising ML theories
- buttons at bottom of a Jupyter notework to:
  - compile with LLVM
  - compile with MLIR
  - compile with Mojo/Modular
- outputs of IR & description
- outputs of ISA & description
- stored in GCP/Azure?
- links to check results with GPT 3.5 and Gemini, etc.



## personal bio plan:

- icons for all langs i know
- quick bio
- photo
