# project one (llvm project) draft 1

## c++ program code ideas: 

  - a simple program with a graph algorithm
  - begins with a list of four Strings which is the input sentence
  - then it creates a graph with each of those words as a node
  - next: apply a transformer algo with a python package and produce an output string
  - next: break down this code block by block or line by line to understand the IR

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Graph {
private:
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> adjacencyList;

public:
    void addEdge(const string& u, const string& v) {
        adjacencyList[u].push_back(v);
        adjacencyList[v].push_back(u); // Assuming undirected graph
    }

    void display() {
        for (const auto& pair : adjacencyList) {
            cout << pair.first << " -> ";
            for (const string& neighbor : pair.second) {
                cout << neighbor << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<string> input = {"This", "is", "a", "sentence"};
    
    Graph graph;
    
    // Create nodes for each word
    for (const string& word : input) {
        graph.addEdge(word, ""); // Adding node for the word
    }
    
    cout << "Graph created with nodes:\n";
    graph.display();
    
    return 0;
}

```

- ability to use a Python library that's compatible with c++
- research these more:


1. NumPy:
NumPy is a Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is one of the most popular Python libraries for scientific computing and is widely used in many different fields, such as machine learning, data science, and image processing. NumPy is written in C and C++ and provides a Python interface.

2. SciPy:
SciPy is a Python library that provides a wide range of scientific computing functions, including statistical functions, signal processing functions, and optimization functions. It is built on top of NumPy and provides a more comprehensive set of scientific computing tools. SciPy is written in C, C++, and Fortran and provides a Python interface.

3. Matplotlib:
Matplotlib is a Python library that provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating 2D and 3D plots. It is widely used in many different fields, such as scientific computing, data science, and machine learning. Matplotlib is written in Python and C++ and provides a Python interface.

4. Pandas:
Pandas is a Python library that provides data structures and operations for working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data. It is built on top of NumPy and provides a more convenient and efficient way to work with data. Pandas is written in Python and C++ and provides a Python interface.

5. PyTorch:
PyTorch is a Python library that provides a deep learning framework. It is widely used in many different fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. PyTorch is written in Python and C++ and provides a Python interface.

6. TensorFlow:
TensorFlow is a Python library that provides a machine learning framework. It is widely used in many different fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. TensorFlow is written in Python and C++ and provides a Python interface.

7. Boost.Python:
Boost.Python is a C++ library that provides a way to create Python bindings for C++ code. This allows you to call C++ functions from Python and to expose C++ classes to Python. Boost.Python is a powerful tool for interfacing between Python and C++.

8. CFFI:
CFFI is a Python library that provides a way to call C functions from Python. It is a lower-level library than Boost.Python, but it is more flexible and allows you to call C functions that are not wrapped by Boost.Python.

9. SWIG:
SWIG is a tool that can be used to generate Python bindings for C and C++ code. It is a powerful tool for interfacing between Python and C/C++.

10. Cython:
Cython is a Python language extension that allows you to write Python code that is compiled to C. This can significantly improve the performance of your Python code. Cython is a good choice for Python code that is computationally intensive.
