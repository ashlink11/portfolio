# project one (llvm project) draft 1

## c++ program code ideas: 

  - a simple program with a graph algorithm
  - begins with a list of four Strings which is the input sentence
  - then it creates a graph with each of those words as a node
  - next: apply a transformer algo with a python package and produce an output string
  - next: break down this code block by block or line by line to understand the IR

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Graph {
private:
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> adjacencyList;

public:
    void addEdge(const string& u, const string& v) {
        adjacencyList[u].push_back(v);
        adjacencyList[v].push_back(u); // Assuming undirected graph
    }

    void display() {
        for (const auto& pair : adjacencyList) {
            cout << pair.first << " -> ";
            for (const string& neighbor : pair.second) {
                cout << neighbor << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<string> input = {"This", "is", "a", "sentence"};
    
    Graph graph;
    
    // Create nodes for each word
    for (const string& word : input) {
        graph.addEdge(word, ""); // Adding node for the word
    }
    
    cout << "Graph created with nodes:\n";
    graph.display();
    
    return 0;
}

```

- ability to use a Python library that's compatible with c++
- research these more:


1. NumPy:

10. Cython:
Cython is a Python language extension that allows you to write Python code that is compiled to C. This can significantly improve the performance of your Python code. Cython is a good choice for Python code that is computationally intensive.


- actually, best packages for ML transformers?

The best Python package for transformers is the Hugging Face Transformers library. It is a state-of-the-art NLP library that provides a wide range of pre-trained models for a variety of tasks, including text classification, question answering, summarization, and translation. The library is easy to use and provides a comprehensive documentation.
Here are some of the key features of the Hugging Face Transformers library:
- Wide range of pre-trained models: The library provides a wide range of pre-trained models for a variety of NLP tasks, including text classification, question answering, summarization, and translation. These models have been trained on large datasets and can be used to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks.
- Easy to use: The library is easy to use and provides a comprehensive documentation. The library provides a number of tutorials and examples that can be used to get started quickly.
- Active community: The library has an active community of users and developers. This means that there is a wealth of resources available to help users get the most out of the library.
- Regular updates: The library is regularly updated with new features and bug fixes. This means that users can be confident that they are using the latest and greatest version of the library.

- Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries â€” `Jax`, `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow` â€” with a seamless integration between them.
- PyTorch is ideal for research and small-scale projects prioritizing flexibility, experimentation and quick editing capabilities for models. TensorFlow is ideal for large-scale projects and production environments that require high-performance and scalable models.

- how can i design Project One (this project) so it's ready for Project Two (mojo/mlir)?
- Project Two additional notes (more than the README):
  - low-level IR in Mojo (implement my own GPU primitives) https://docs.modular.com/mojo/notebooks/BoolMLIR
  - Jax: "accelerator-oriented array computation and program transformation, designed for high-performance numerical computing"
  - Mojo language marries Python and MLIR for AI development: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3695588/mojo-language-marries-python-and-mlir-for-ai-development.html
  - key Mojo
    - progressive types
    - parallelization
    - ownership and borrow-checker
    - manual memory management
    - zero-cost abstractions
    - integrated auto-tuning ******* use this 
  - Lattner Lex Fridman will mojo replace PyTorch and Tensorflow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vz2X9I5Z4k
  - Modular yt channel Introduction to Tensors in MojoðŸ”¥: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OWkXNdkx8E
  - why mojo: https://docs.modular.com/mojo/why-mojo
    - "building our platform to unify the world's ML/AI infrastructure, we realized that programming across the entire stack was too complicated. Plus, we were writing a lot of MLIR by hand and not having a good time."
    - "What we wanted was an innovative and scalable programming model that could target accelerators and other heterogeneous systems that are pervasive in the AI field. This meant a programming language with powerful compile-time metaprogramming, integration of adaptive compilation techniques, caching throughout the compilation flow, and other features that are not supported by existing languages."
   
- takeaways:
  - okay i wont be doing ^that till Project Two
  - so Project One should just be compiling LLVM and high-level/low-level IR analysis and then compare it later to Mojo/MLIR
  - alright, now I can continue with Project One

- next step:
  - CMake desktop app? (then what would be the target?)
  - CMake config with git clone llvm as target?
  - CMake config with native llvm as target? change $PATH
  - ^this has been super difficult. but at least i've studied it a tonnnnn


# DEADLINE: (pushing this back a week) next FRIDAY March 29 I have to compile the simplest c++ program possible with LLVM

# next steps: (wed mar 20)

- i learned yesterday that CUDA uses CMake to compile so this will be worth it

tring to keep in mind all the factors as i'm trying. common errors:

- Missing Dependencies: correctly installed on your system and properly detected by CMake
- Version Compatibility: Ensure that you are using compatible versions of LLVM and its dependencies. Sometimes, certain LLVM features or functionalities might not be supported in older or newer versions, leading to configuration issues.
- CMake Cache: Sometimes, CMake cache files can cause problems. Try deleting the CMake cache (typically named CMakeCache.txt) in your build directory and re-running CMake to regenerate it.
- Build Configuration: LLVM supports various build configurations, such as Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, and MinSizeRel. Make sure you are configuring CMake with the appropriate build configuration for your needs.
- Platform-specific Issues: LLVM might have platform-specific requirements or issues. Ensure that you are following any platform-specific instructions or recommendations provided by the LLVM project.
- Compiler Compatibility: Ensure that your compiler is compatible with LLVM. LLVM often requires a modern C++ compiler (e.g., Clang or a recent version of GCC).
- CMake Options: LLVM provides various CMake options to customize the build process. Make sure you are setting these options appropriately for your requirements.
- Check most recent official docs from LLVM and CMake


# next steps: (fri mar 21)
- need time honestly for my schoolwork till monday
