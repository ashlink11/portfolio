# high-level

notes:
- try out vercel frontend components tools
  - then: what's my tech stack? 
- UI layout sketches while considering UX
  - i think different phases of each project should be diff colors though.
  - maybe each project could vary by:
    - color? no.
    - hue? no but maybe for a combined plan B
    - font? no but maybe plan C
    - depth/flat/shadows? no but maybe for a combined plan B
- additional UI elements:
  - static elements:
    - gantt
    - excel
    - lucidchart
    - screenshots of different parts of the program? doubt it.
  - dynamic elements:
    - buttons
      - to change colors for teaching effect
      - code carousel
    - embedded jupyter notebook

# mid-level

### progress april 6, 2024:
- v0 can accept either images or prompt
- so next step is to design the UI on paper
  - consider:
    - colors
    - font & font size
    - mobile-first
    - laptop display
    - embedded jupyter notebook
    - page speed
    - whichever PWA ideals i met with this site
  - pages/elements:
    - home (traditional portfolio page)
      - name
      - logos of all technologies i know
      - photo
      - bio (how many sections? 1?) what's the overlap btw this, resume, and linkedin, etc.?
        - selected hobbies? 
    - project one
    - project two
    - project three
    - where does the overall projects evolution summary go?
    - visuals:
      - dynamic and static elements
      - which minimal maps/charts? and how to make them minimal?
        - options other than lucidchart for SWA diagrams
          - [top 8 SWA diagramming tools medium article](https://icepanel.medium.com/top-8-diagramming-tools-for-software-architecture-2fc61d095b93): "Software architecture tools can be categorized into three groups, modelling tools, diagrams as code and diagramming tools."
            - Excalidraw (most aesthetic)
            - Gliffy for UML & ERD diagrams - use idea but not aesthetic design
            - Cloudskew - idea of using tech logos for a tech stack diagram, etc.
            - Trello for Kanban to demo Agile/Scrum
              - high-level: portfolio project
              - mid-level: releases for corresponding backend/frontend milestones
                - github PRs 
              - low-level: sprints (good sprint lengths - 2 weeks)
              - agile charter
              - PBIs
              - scrum events
                - track daily scrums vs github commit messages
                - how much of all this is sidebar topics? #key
              - Miro instead of Excalidram and Gliffy
              - essentially Miro vs Lucidchart
          - high/mid/low levels and can i combine them somehow?
          - include my github contributions annual charts somehow
    - any more pages?
      - a super minimal contact page last unless that's bad UX
      - an almost purely map/chart page?
      - way to demo 'database'/data for the site
      - demo frontend knowledge including PWA & tech stacks & react 'standard library', etc.
      - an evo/map of ML page?
      - a page showing the evolution of my jobs and 2 open-source projects?
        - link to best w3f code/evaluations 
      - a page showing how i built this portfolio site? (or on github repo readme?)
      - a page/dropdown menu for a demo of any other key technologies i know?
        - something fun?
        - something interactive?
      - extremely short and/or longer embedded youtube videos demoing projects/learnings
        - this could demo all the different meta-map ideas like math, linguistics, philosophy, business, etc. to show both generalization and specialization and evolution of last decade of programming 
      - person project concept page with LLM/linguistics/identity language personal development 
    - think about what content will be on & links to:
      - LinkedIn (posts?)
      - resume ((but might be different for each/some applications))
      - ((don't link cover letters of course))
      - put new email on there (Ashley Grevelink - ashley.grevelink@gmail.com)
      - twitter
      - medium
      - github & repo(s) READMEs/selected code (good for project code)
