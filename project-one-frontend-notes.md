# high-level

notes:
- try out vercel frontend components tools
  - then: what's my tech stack? 
- UI layout sketches while considering UX
  - i think different phases of each project should be diff colors though.
  - maybe each project could vary by:
    - color? no.
    - hue? no but maybe for a combined plan B
    - font? no but maybe plan C
    - depth/flat/shadows? no but maybe for a combined plan B
- additional UI elements:
  - static elements:
    - gantt
    - excel
    - lucidchart
    - screenshots of different parts of the program? doubt it.
  - dynamic elements:
    - buttons
      - to change colors for teaching effect
      - code carousel
    - embedded jupyter notebook

### progress april 6, 2024:
- v0 can accept either images or prompt
- so next step is to design the UI on paper
  - pages/elements:
    - home (traditional portfolio page)
      - logos of all technologies i know
      - photo
      - bio (how many sections? 1?) what's the diff btw this and resume? 
    - project one
    - project two
    - project three
    - where does the overall project evolution summary go?
    - any more pages?
    - links to LinkedIn, resume, put email on there, etc.
  - consider:
    - colors
    - font size
    - mobile-first
    - laptop
    - embedded jupyter notebook
